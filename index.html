<p>This was an assignment for my introductory engineering school class. I built this solar powered prototype with my group members. It was really easy, considering it was the first assignment in the class. And the parts of this prototype were easy to figure out the function of. All we had to do was to assemble it.<br><br>
    The solar panel provides electricity to the engine through wires. The engine drives the wheels through a rubber band. Technically speaking, this is a rear-wheel drive vehicle. This is not a perfect solar-powered prototype vehicle. It's still just a prototype. There are many shortcomings that need to be improved. It needs to be iterated afterwards<br><br>
    After this, we also assembled a more advanced car. Through a camera, our car can follow the lines of the ground. It can move at the speed we set. It can even make turns.<br><br>
    Although the first car had many drawbacks. It couldn't turn and it couldn't change its speed. It can't even switch on and off. But I still have fond memories of it. I think it was this little car that got me interested in the engineering field and made me hope to pursue a career in the future.<br><br>

<h3 id="blog_2">3D Printing Prototype</h3>
<a href="about.html" rel="author">Zhang</a><br>
<time datetime="2022-10-14">October 14, 2022</time>

<p><img class="blog_image" src="3D_Printing.jpeg" alt="3d printing prototype"></p>
<p>This is a prototype I recently 3d printed. I was asked to design a phone stand. I drew three different concept designs. One was for a multi-device design. One was a design that came to me out of the blue. The last one was a very common design. Then, I chose the one I liked the most to build a model from it. <br><br>
    When I was designing this model, I was thinking why people always separate the cell phone and the cell phone holder. It would be more convenient if the phone holder and the phone could be combined together. And I think that the phone case would be the best choice. After all, the most common part with the phone is basically the case. Then, how to make the case complete the role of the bracket is another test. 3d printing material is not very elastic, and very fragile.<br><br>
    Until the last moment, I did not think of a good solution. I could only print it out first, and then think if there is a better way. And I found that the connection of the bracket is a little less stable. I had to choose to reinforce it with tape. <br>
